# History

## graphically visualize history

It’s also useful to graphically visualize history.

### Windows

Gitk is a tool for viewing the history of Git repositories. It’s usually installed with Git but may need to be installed by your package manager or separately. Its ability to graphically visualize Git’s history is particularly helpful when history becomes more complex (say, with merges and remote
branches). You can see it running on Windows 8.1 in figure 1.5.

### Linux

There are more attractive, up-to-date, and platform-native alternatives to `gitk`. On Linux/Unix, I instead recommend using tools such as `gitg` for **gtk+/GNOME** integration and `QGit` for **Qt/KDE** integration. These can be installed using your package manager.

Debian 9 GNOME:

```bash
sudo apt install gitg
```
