## 1. Creating a repository: `git init`

Let’s start by initializing an empty, new local repository.

`git init` can be run without any arguments to create the local Git repository in the current directory.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir demo && cd demo/
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/tom/demo/.git/
```

## 2. Creating a new commit: `git add`, `git commit`

**The typical workflow** is that you’ll change the contents of files in a repository, review the `diffs`, add them to the `index`, create a new `commit` from the contents of the index, and repeat this cycle.

第一次提交

```bash
$ echo "I love three things in this world" > hello.txt
## add file to the staging area
$ git add hello.txt
```

```bash
## Committing changes staged in the index
$ git commit --message "First Commit"
[master (root-commit) 50af687] First Commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

- `master`: the name of the branch where the commit was made (the default, `master`)
- `root-commit`: It’s shown only for the first commit in a repository and means this commit has no parent.
- `50af687`: the shortened SHA1
- `First Commit`: the commit message
- `1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`: the number of files changed and the number of lines inserted or deleted across all the files in this commit.
- `create mode 100644 hello.txt`: a new file was created, along with the Unix file mode ( 100644 )


```txt
[<branch_name> (root-commit) <shortened_sha1>] <commit_message>
 <file_number> file changed, <add_num> insertion(+), <del_num> deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 <file_name>
```

第二次提交

```bash
$ echo "the sun, the moon, and you" >> hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit --message "Second Commit"
[master d0dfea8] Second Commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

第三次提交

```bash
$ echo "the Sun for the day" >> hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit --message "Third Commit"
[master c21c004] Third Commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

第四次提交

```bash
$ cat hello.txt
I love three things in this world
the Sun, the Moon, and You
the Sun for the day
the Moon for the night
and You forever
$ git add hello.txt
$ git commit --message "Fourth Commit"
[master 03d87df] Fourth Commit
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

三个概念：

- Local repository directory
- Local index file
- Local working directory

命令 VS 三个概念：

- `git add`: Local working directory --> Local index file
- `git commit`: Local index file --> Local repository directory
- `git checkout`: Local repository directory --> Local working directory

三个命令，就像轮回一样。

三个概念 VS FileSystem:

- Local repository directory: `~/GitInPractice/.git/`
- Local index file: `~/GitInPractice/.git/index`
- Local working directory: `~/GitInPractice/`，但不包括`.git/`目录

Git’s `index` is a **staging area** used to build up new commits. Rather than require all changes in the working tree to make up the next commit, Git allows files to be added incrementally to the `index`.

When a file is added to the `index`, a file named `.git/index` is created (if it doesn’t already exist). The added file contents and metadata are then added to the `index` file.

| Git Commands | Git Concepts      |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
|              | repository        |
| `git commit` |                   |
|              | staging area      |
| `git add`    |                   |
|              | working directory |

Staging Area

Git includes an intermediate level between the directory where content is created and edited, and the repository where content is committed.

## 3. Viewing history: `git log`

The history in Git is the complete list of all `commit`s made since the repository was created. The history also contains references to any `branche`s, `merge`s, and `tag`s made within the repository.

When you’re using Git, you’ll find yourself regularly checking the history: sometimes to **remind yourself of your own work**, sometimes to **see why other changes were made in the past**, and sometimes **reading new changes that have been made by others**.

Run `git log` and, if necessary, `q` to exit.

```bash
## History
$ git log
$ git log --oneline
```
